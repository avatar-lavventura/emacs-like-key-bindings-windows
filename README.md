# Emacs-like (Mac-like) key-binding on Windows using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Setup 

Downnload and run [the compiled standalone version](https://github.com/usuyama/emacs-key-binding-windows/releases/tag/v0.1)

## Usage

We'll use CapsLock as the \<Control> modifier key in Emacs. We can still use the original Ctrl keys for Windows shortcuts like Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v.
